# KaosPhysics

The KaosPhysics project started with the `elements.html` page
 - an interactive and internationalized Periodic Table of the Elements.
It became necessary to model the required data in a strongly-typed environment so C# was chosen.
The .NET codebase generates JSON for the nuclides table and HTML for the tables themselves.

The term 'nuclides' is used for the elements table because it includes the neutron at index 0, followed by hydrogen, etc.
This allows using an element's atomic number (proton count) as the array index.

### Folder contents

#### Pages folder

The `elements.html` file is an HTML/RSS/JavaScript page that displays the Periodic Table of the Elements.
Find stable versions here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/elements.html

The goals of the Elements page are:

* Display the Periodic Table of the Elements in selectable standard, 32-column, or left-step format.
* Provide a plethora of switchable themes.
* Provide full support for multiple languages, including English variants.
* Detect user language on page load for best-fit initial setting.
* Use responsive CSS to provide basic functionality even without JavaScript.
* Limit to a self-contained, single file with no dependencies - installation by copying one file.

#### `DotGenJson` folder

This folder contains a .NET Core project that builds `DotGenJson.exe` for generating machine readable data of the KaosPhysics model.

* Provides full translations of element names for de, en, en-GB, en-US, es, it, ru.
* Generates JSON by default or Javascript with the `-js` switch.

Usage: `DotGenJson.exe [-js]`

#### `DotElements` folder

The contained .NET Core project builds the `DotElements.exe` program for generating human readable data of the KaosPhysics model.
This program outputs a compact fixed-column listing of the elements followed by a fixed-column listing of their isotopes.
Provide a language argument to show chemical element names other than English.

Usage: `DotElements.exe [lang]`

#### `Source` folder

The Source folder contains the C# source to the class libary defined in the Kaos.Physics namespace.

This library currently consists of two classes:

* The `Nuclide` class which includes the elements.
* The `Isotope` class.

#### `TestCore` folder

The TestCore folder contains a MSTest project that ensures the nuclides table hasn't gotten munged.

### JSON Data

Here is an excerpt from the `.json` file generated by `DotGenJson.exe`:

```json
"nuclides":
[
  { "z":  0, "symbol": "n",  "period": 0, "group": 0, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": " ", "occurrenceIndex": 1, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1932, "discoveryIndex": 4, "atm0StateIndex": 0, "melt":     null, "boil":     null, "weight":   1.0080, "stableCount": 0, "stabilityIndex": 4, "isotopes": [[1,100,4,610.1]] },
  { "z":  1, "symbol": "H",  "period": 1, "group": 1, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 2, "lifeIndex": 1, "discoveryYear": 1766, "discoveryIndex": 1, "atm0StateIndex": 3, "melt":  13.9900, "boil":  20.2710, "weight":   1.0080, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [[1,99.98],[2,0.02],[3,0,4,388781648.64]] },
  { "z":  2, "symbol": "He", "period": 1, "group":18, "categoryIndex": 9, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 2, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1868, "discoveryIndex": 2, "atm0StateIndex": 3, "melt":   0.9500, "boil":   4.2220, "weight":   4.0026, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [[3,0.0002],[4,99.9998]] },
]
```

Access the chemical elements by indexing the above `nuclides` array with atomic numbers.
Element names are stored separately in `nuclideNames` for language selection.
Here is trimmed excerpt of that object:

```json
  "nuclideNames": {
    "de"  : [ "Neutron",  "Wasserstoff", "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "en"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "enGB": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "enUS": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "es"  : [ "Neutrón",  "Hidrógeno",   "Helio",  "Litio",   "..." ],
    "fr"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogène",   "Hélium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "it"  : [ "Neutrone", "Hydrogène",   "Elio",   "Litio",   "..." ],
    "ru"  : [ "Водород",  "Нейтрон",     "Гелий",  "Литий",   "..." ]
}
```

Next is a JavaScript (`.js`) example that shows the symbol for Z=2 followed by its name in Spain.

```js
alert ("Symbol=" + nuclides[2].symbol);
alert ("Name in Spain=" + nuclideNames["es"][2]);
```

Several columns are index values that require lookups.
Corresponding lookup tables are provided.

The `isotopes` array varies in length depending on stability:

* Stable isotopes
  * Neutron count (A)
  * Natural abundance percentage
* Radioactive isotopes append 2 more values
  * Decay mode flags
  * Half-life
  
See tritium (Z=1, A=3) for an example of a radioactive isotope.

### C# Data

The source for the JSON data produced above is the *KaosPhysics* C# shared project.
Here is an excerpt of a constructor:

```cs
public static Nuclide Hydrogen { get; } = new Nuclide
(
    z: 1, symbol: "H", name: nameof (Hydrogen), category: Category.Nonmetal, period: 1, group: 1,
    melt: 13.99, boil: 20.271, weight: 1.008,
    life: Nutrition.BulkEssential,
    known: 1766, credit: "Henry Cavindish",
    naming: "From Greek, meaning water-former",
    isotopes: new Isotope[] { new Isotope (1, 99.98), new Isotope (2, 0.02), new Isotope (3, 0.0, 12.32*31556952.0, Decay.BetaMinus) },
    nameMap: new Dictionary<string,string> { { "de","Wasserstoff" }, { "es","Hidrógeno" }, { "fr","Hydrogène" }, { "it","Hydrogène" }, { "ru","Нейтрон" } }
);
```

An element may be accessed as a singleton but will usually be accessed from the nuclides array (also a singleton).
So hydrogen would be `Nuclides.Table[1]`.

The `name` parameter is used as the element name for the 'en' language.
Nuclide name translations are provided by the `nameMap` dictionary constructor parameter.
If no entry exists for a language, then it will default to the value for the 'en' language.
Use the `GetName(lang)` method to get the element's name for the supplied language.
