# KaosPhysics

The KaosPhysics project started with the `elements.html` page
 - an interactive and internationalized Periodic Table of the Elements.
It became necessary to model the required data in a strongly-typed environment so C# was chosen.
The .NET codebase generates JSON for the nuclides table and HTML for the tables themselves.

The term 'nuclides' is used for the elements table because it includes the neutron at index 0, followed by hydrogen, etc.
This allows using an element's atomic number (proton count) as the array index.

### Folder contents

#### Pages folder

The `elements.html` file is an HTML/RSS/JavaScript page that displays the Periodic Table of the Elements.
Find stable versions here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/elements.html

The goals of the *Elements* web page are:

* Display the Periodic Table of the Elements in either standard, 32-column, or left-step format.
* Provide a plethora of switchable themes.
* Provide full support for multiple languages, including English variants.
* Detect user language on page load for best-fit initial setting.
* Use responsive CSS to provide adaptable output without JavaScript.
* Limit to a single file with no dependencies for ease of distribution and offline functionality.

#### DotGenJson folder

The `DotGenJson` folder contains a .NET Core project that builds `DotGenJson.exe`
for generating machine readable data of the KaosPhysics model.

* Generates JSON by default or JavaScript with the `-js` switch.
* Provides full translations of element names for de, en, en-GB, en-US, es, it, ru.

Usage: `DotGenJson.exe [-js]`

See contents here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/data/kaosNuclides.json

#### DotElements folder

The `DotGenJson` folder contains a .NET Core project that builds `DotElements.exe`
for generating human readable data of the KaosPhysics model.
This program produces a narrow, fixed-width listing of the elements
followed by a fixed-column listing of their isotopes.
To show elements in names other than world-English, provide a 2 or 5 character language code.

Usage: `DotElements.exe [languageCode]`

See contents here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/data/kaosNuclides-en.txt

#### DotKaosPhysics

This folder contains a class library build of the KaosPhysics model defined by the `Kaos.Physics` namespace.
This library is built in the form of a `.nuget` package.

#### Source folder

This folder contains the C# source to the KaosPhysics model in a shared project.
The recommeded way to use KaosPhysics is to include this shared project directly.

This library consists of two classes:

* The `Nuclide` class which consists of the neutron followed by the elements.
* The `Isotope` class.

See the files `Nuclide.cs` and `Isotope.cs` here:

https://github.com/kaosborn/KaosPhysics/tree/master/Source/KaosPhysics

#### TestCore folder

This folder contains a MSTest project that ensures the nuclides table hasn't gotten totally munged.

### JSON data

Here is an excerpt from the `.json` file generated by running `DotGenJson.exe`:

```json
"nuclides": [
  { "z":  0, "symbol": "n",  "period": 0, "group": 0, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": " ", "occurrenceIndex": 1, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1932, "discoveryIndex": 4, "stateIndex": 0, "melt":     null, "boil":     null, "weight":   1.000, "stableCount": 0, "stabilityIndex": 4, "isotopes": [{"z":0,"a":1,"abundance":0,"occurrenceIndex":1,"stabilityIndex":4,"decayFlags":4,"halflife":610.1}] },
  { "z":  1, "symbol": "H",  "period": 1, "group": 1, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 3, "lifeIndex": 1, "discoveryYear": 1766, "discoveryIndex": 1, "stateIndex": 3, "melt":   13.990, "boil":   20.271, "weight":   1.008, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [{"z":1,"a":1,"abundance":99.98,"occurrenceIndex":3}, {"z":1,"a":2,"abundance":0.02,"occurrenceIndex":3}, {"z":1,"a":3,"abundance":0,"occurrenceIndex":1,"stabilityIndex":3,"decayFlags":4,"halflife":388781648.64}] },
  { "z":  2, "symbol": "He", "period": 1, "group":18, "categoryIndex": 9, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 3, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1868, "discoveryIndex": 2, "stateIndex": 3, "melt":    0.950, "boil":    4.222, "weight":   4.003, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [{"z":2,"a":3,"abundance":0.0002,"occurrenceIndex":3}, {"z":2,"a":4,"abundance":99.9998,"occurrenceIndex":3}] },
  { "z":  3, "symbol": "Li", "period": 2, "group": 1, "categoryIndex": 0, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 3, "lifeIndex": 2, "discoveryYear": 1817, "discoveryIndex": 2, "stateIndex": 1, "melt":  453.650, "boil": 1603.000, "weight":   6.940, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [{"z":3,"a":6,"abundance":7.59,"occurrenceIndex":3}, {"z":3,"a":7,"abundance":92.41,"occurrenceIndex":3}] }
]
```

Access the chemical elements by indexing the above `nuclides` array with atomic numbers.
Element names are stored separately in `nuclideNames` for language selection.
Here is trimmed excerpt of that object:

```json
"nuclideNames": {
  "de"  : [ "Neutron",  "Wasserstoff", "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
  "en"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
  "enGB": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
  "enUS": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
  "es"  : [ "Neutrón",  "Hidrógeno",   "Helio",  "Litio",   "..." ],
  "fr"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogène",   "Hélium", "Lithium", "..." ],
  "it"  : [ "Neutrone", "Hydrogène",   "Elio",   "Litio",   "..." ],
  "ru"  : [ "Водород",  "Нейтрон",     "Гелий",  "Литий",   "..." ]
}
```

### Using JSON data

Next is a JavaScript (`.js`) example that shows the symbol for Z=2 followed by its name in Spain.

```js
alert ("Symbol=" + nuclides[2].symbol);
alert ("Name in Spain=" + nuclideNames["es"][2]);
```

Several columns are index values that require lookups.
Corresponding lookup tables are provided with language translations.

The `isotopes` array items vary in length depending on stability:

* Stable isotopes
  * Neutron count (A)
  * Natural abundance percentage
  * Natural occurrence index
* Radioactive isotopes include 3 more values
  * Stability index
  * Decay mode bitflags
  * Half-life

See tritium (Z=1, A=3) for an example of a radioactive isotope.

The *Elements* web page uses data in `KaosPhysics.json` to produce its content.
For example, the following potassium isotopes table is built dynamically from JSON data:

[[Images/element-19-isotopes.png]]

See the entire page here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/elements.html?theme=stab;z=19

### C# data

The source for the JSON data produced above is the *KaosPhysics* C# shared project.
Here is an excerpt of a constructor:

```cs
public static Nuclide Hydrogen { get; } = new Nuclide
(
    z: 1, symbol: "H", name: nameof (Hydrogen),
    category: Category.Nonmetal,
    period: 1, group: 1,
    melt: 13.99, boil: 20.271,
    weight: 1.008,
    life: Nutrition.BulkEssential,
    known: 1766, credit: "Henry Cavindish",
    naming: "From Greek, meaning water-former",
    isotopes: new Isotope[] { new Isotope (1, 1, 99.98), new Isotope (1, 2, 0.02), new Isotope (1, 3, 0.0, 12.32*31556952.0, Decay.BetaMinus) },
    nameMap: new Dictionary<string,string> { { "de","Wasserstoff" }, { "es","Hidrógeno" }, { "fr","Hydrogène" }, { "it","Hydrogène" }, { "ru","Нейтрон" } }
);
```

The element constructed above may be accessed as a singleton
but will usually be accessed from the nuclides array (also a singleton).
Actual property names of the object are camel-cased versions of the argument names.
Other properties are available such as `OccurrenceIndex`, `StabilityCount`, and `Life`.
These properties are calculated from the encapsulated isotopes arrays.

The `name` parameter is used as the element name for the 'en' language.
Nuclide name translations are provided by the `nameMap` dictionary constructor parameter.
If no entry exists for a language, then it will default to the value for the 'en' language.
Use the `GetName(lang)` method to get the element's name for the supplied argument.

```cs
Console.WriteLine ("H name in Spain: " + Nuclide.Table[1].GetName("es"));
```
