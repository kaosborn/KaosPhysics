# KaosPhysics

The KaosPhysics project started with the `Elements.html` page
 - an interactive and internationalized Periodic Table of the Elements.
It became necessary to model the required data in a strongly-typed environment so C# was chosen.
The .NET codebase generates JSON for the nuclides table and HTML for the tables themselves.

The term 'nuclides' is used for the elements list because it includes the neutron at index 0, followed by hydrogen, etc.
This means that an element's atomic number may serve as an index into the nuclides list within C# or JSON.

### Folder contents

#### Pages folder

The `Elements.html` file is an HTML/RSS/JavaScript page that displays the Periodic Table of the Elements.
Find released versions here:

https://kaosborn.github.io/posts/Elements.html

The goals of the Elements page are:

* Display the Periodic Table of the Elements in selectable standard, 32-column, or left-step format.
* Provide a plethora of switchable themes.
* Provide full support for multiple languages, including English variants.
* Detect user language on page load for best-fit initial setting.
* Use responsive CSS to provide basic functionality even without JavaScript.
* Limit to a self-contained, single file with no dependencies - installation by copying one file.

#### `DotGenJson` folder

This folder contains a .NET Core project that builds `DotGenJson.exe` for generating machine readable data from the KaosPhysics model.

* Provides full translations of element names for de, en, en-GB, en-US, es, it, ru.
* Generates JSON by default or Javascript with the `-js` switch.

Usage: `DotGenJson.exe [-js]`

#### `DotElements` folder

The contained .NET Core project builds the `DotElements.exe` program for generating human readable data of the KaosPhysics model.
This program outputs a compact fixed-column listing of the elements followed by a fixed-column listing of their isotopes.
Provide a language argument to show chemical element names other than English.

Usage: `DotElements.exe [lang]`

#### `Source` folder

The Source folder contains the C# source to the class libary defined in the Kaos.Physics namespace.

This library consists of two classes:

* The `Nuclide` class. This includes the static `Table` collection which includes the 118 elements and the neutron with their isotopes.
* The `Isotope` class.

#### `TestCore` folder

The TestCore folder contains a MSTest project that ensures the nuclides table hasn't gotten munged.

### JSON Data

Here is an excerpt from the generated `.json` file generated by `DotGenJson.exe`:

```json
"nuclides":
[
{ "z":  0, "symbol": "n",  "period": 0, "group": 0, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": " ", "occurrenceIndex": 1, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1932, "discoveryIndex": 4, "atm0StateIndex": 0, "melt":     null, "boil":     null, "weight":   1.0080, "stableCount": 0, "stabilityIndex": 4, "isotopes": [[1,100,2,610.1]] },
{ "z":  1, "symbol": "H",  "period": 1, "group": 1, "categoryIndex": 7, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 2, "lifeIndex": 1, "discoveryYear": 1766, "discoveryIndex": 1, "atm0StateIndex": 3, "melt":  13.9900, "boil":  20.2710, "weight":   1.0080, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [[1,99.98],[2,0.02],[3,0,4,388781648.64]] },
{ "z":  2, "symbol": "He", "period": 1, "group":18, "categoryIndex": 9, "block": "s", "occurrenceIndex": 2, "lifeIndex": 0, "discoveryYear": 1868, "discoveryIndex": 2, "atm0StateIndex": 3, "melt":   0.9500, "boil":   4.2220, "weight":   4.0026, "stableCount": 2, "stabilityIndex": 0, "isotopes": [[3,0.0002],[4,99.9998]] },
]
```

Access the chemical elements by indexing the `nuclides` array with an atomic number.
Element names are stored separately in the `nuclideNames` object for language translation.
Here is an excerpt:

```json
  "nuclideNames": {
    "de"  : [ "Neutron",  "Wasserstoff", "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "en"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "enGB": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "enUS": [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogen",    "Helium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "es"  : [ "Neutrón",  "Hidrógeno",   "Helio",  "Litio",   "..." ],
    "fr"  : [ "Neutron",  "Hydrogène",   "Hélium", "Lithium", "..." ],
    "it"  : [ "Neutrone", "Hydrogène",   "Elio",   "Litio",   "..." ],
    "ru"  : [ "Водород",  "Нейтрон",     "Гелий",  "Литий",   "..." ]
}
```

Next is a Javscript example that shows the symbol for Z=2 followed by its name in Spain.

```js
alert ("Symbol = " + nuclides[2].symbol);
alert ("Name in Spain = " + nuclideNames["es"][2]);
```

Several columns are index values that require lookups.
Appropriate lookup tables are provided.

Isotopes are represented as an array:

* Stable isotopes are an array with 2 elements: atomic mass (A) and abundance as a percentage.
* Radioactive isotopes append 2 more values: the decay mode flags and half-life. See tritium (A=3) for an example.

### C# Data

The source data for JSON produced above is from the *KaosPhysics* C# shared project.
Here is an excerpt of a constructor:

```cs
public static Nuclide Hydrogen { get; } = new Nuclide
(
    z: 1, symbol: "H", name: nameof (Hydrogen), category: Category.Nonmetal, period: 1, group: 1,
    melt: 13.99, boil: 20.271,
    weight: 1.008,
    life: Nutrition.BulkEssential,
    known: 1766, credit: "Henry Cavindish",
    naming: "From Greek, meaning water-former",
    isotopes: new Isotope[] { new Isotope (1, 99.98), new Isotope (2, 0.02), new Isotope (3, 0.0, 12.32*31556952.0, Decay.BetaMinus) },
    nameMap: new Dictionary<string,string> { { "de","Wasserstoff" }, { "es","Hidrógeno" }, { "fr","Hydrogène" }, { "it","Hydrogène" }, { "ru","Нейтрон" } }
);
```

Elements may be accessed as singletons but will usually be addressed by Z index such as `Nuclides.Table[1]`.
Access isotopes with an element's index operator.

Nuclide name translations are provided by the `nameMap` dictionary constructor parameter.
If no entry exists for a language, then it will default to the value of `name`.
Use the `GetName(lang)` method to the element's name for the supplied language.
